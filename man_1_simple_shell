.SH NAME
hsh \- simple Unix command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIcommand_file\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hsh
program is a simple Unix command interpreter similar to
.B /bin/sh
or
.B /bin/bash,
but with limited functionality. It reads commands from either standard input
(non-interactive mode) or from the user in interactive mode.

.PP
If commands are piped into
.B hsh
or specified in a file, the shell processes them until EOF and then exits.
Otherwise, if started without a file, the shell displays a prompt
.BR "$ "
and waits for user input.

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B hsh
program does not accept any specific command-line options. However, standard Unix
conventions such as redirection and pipes apply.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. If no argument is given, the shell exits with the status of
the last command executed.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.SH EXAMPLES
Running interactively:
.EX
$ hsh
$ ls
.B ...
$ exit
.EE

Running non-interactively:
.EX
$ echo "ls" | hsh
.B ...
$ cat commands.txt | hsh
.EE
